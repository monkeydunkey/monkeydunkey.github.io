                  One of the problem that I faced when I took part in my first Data Sciece competition was how to go about
                  this whole process, I am sure many others faced something similar. The theoretical knowledge which all of us
                  try and accumulate before taking part in any such competition
                  does not really help much if you don't know how to properly apply that knowledge in practice. Anyone with
                  experience in building data analysis pipeline will agree that much of the decision process is huerestic in nature
                  i.e. the decisions taken while building the model depends on the data at hand. There is no user manual, one
                  could follow to get the optimal results. This is exactly where experience comes into play. There is no
                  subsitute for it and can only be gained by constantly trying out

                  This post is about a thought process technique that I found really helpful in trying to tackle a lot the
                  decisions that needs to be made. The process is really simple, it is all about thinking how you a human
                  would go about performing the task you want the machine to do.
