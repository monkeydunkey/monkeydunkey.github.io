                  <br>
                  When I first started learning data science and machine learning, I had a few goals in my mind:
                  <ol type = "a">
                    <li> Learn all these fancy machine learning techniques</li>
                    <li> Win big bucks in Kaggle competitions by using the above learned techniques</li>
                  </ol>
                  Naturally, with such goals in mind I sought out the fastest way to accomplish all of this.
                  The hacker inside me knew that there was a shortcut to it all and reading up on basic techniques
                  was not worth as they were never used in a real world scenario, or so I thought. After reading up
                  a lot of blogs on the cutting edge models used by Kaggle competition winner, I decided to enter a
                  competition and try out my new learned skill :D. After creating a lot of
                  <a href = "parametricVnonparametric.html">parametric and non-parametric models</a> and
                  ensembling them (yup first attempt at my first competition I was ensembling models), I decided to upload my solution. Before uploading I saw that
                  scores of quite a few people were less than even the sample submission provided by the competition master
                  and I thought to myself how bad can you suck at this that the sample is better than your solution.
                  So, laughing at these people I uploaded my solution and after seeing the results my laughter changed into
                  bewilderment, I was at the bottom of the leaderboard, lower than any of the people I was just laughing at.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  My brain went into complete denial, this can’t be true I applied at methods used by competition winners, how
                  can I be at the bottom? There must have been a mistake, I must have uploaded the wrong file. So, after
                  re-uploading the files and trying to change the parameters in the models used, it slowly dawned on me that my
                  solution sucked. So I started looking at the discussion forum and kernels that other people had created to try
                  an understand what went wrong. I found a kernel in which a guy discussed his approach and his approach was
                  fairly simple, he used only one of the techniques used by me and yet his solution was a hundred times better
                  than mine. So what was the difference, he applied a small transformation to his data to handle highly skewed
                  variables and that was it. This one simple thing made his solution perform far better than mine.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  It was then that I realized that fancy shiny methods are nice but they really cannot work if the dataset does
                  not suit them. And the best to understand a dataset as to which methods can be applied is to try out the simple
                  things first
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  tldr: Tried fancy stuff without understanding the basics.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Now let’s see how one of the easiest method <a href = "#">Term frequency</a> can reveal interesting information a dataset
