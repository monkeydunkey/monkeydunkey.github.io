                  The main aim of any statistical or machine learning model is to predict the relationship
                  between the predictors and respose variable. This relation can be written as:-
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Y = &#402(X) + &#949
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Here &#402() is an estimate of the actual relationship between the predictor and response
                  variable and &#949 is the irreducible error term (caused due to factors not captured by our
                  predictor variables). Obviously, as per its name we cannot reduce the irreducible error part.
                  What we can reduce is the error caused by difference in our estimate of the relationship between
                  X and Y and the actual relationship. This error that we can reduce and make out model better,
                  is made up of <I>Variance</I> and <I>Bias</I>, both of which are introduced by our selection
                  of model.
                  <br>
                  Generally, we can write the error in our estimate as:
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp E(y<sub>i</sub> - &#402(x<sub>i</sub>)) = Var(&#402(x<sub>i</sub>)) + [Bias(&#402(x<sub>i</sub>))]<sup>2</sup> + Var(&#949)
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  So, what are these terms intutively:
                  <ul>
                    <li> <B>Variance</B>: It is the amount by which &#402 will differ if we were we to train the model
                              again using a different set of data </li>
                    <li> <B>Bias</B>: It is the error created by approximating a real life problem, which may be complicated
                            by a much simpler model</li>
                  </ul>
                  Variance in caused when the model starts to fit the training data way too closely and in turn even fits in the
                  noise in the training data. A good example of such models are the non-parametric models. On the other hand
                  a good example of the models that introduces Bias are the parametric models such as linear regression.
                  <br>
                  So, either type of model <a href="parametricvnonparametric.html">parametric or non-parametric</a>
                  does not garauntee both low Variance as well Bias. In practice one has to strike a balance and try to
                  reduce both bias and variance as much as possible in order to reduce the error
