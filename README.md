This is my attempt to share what I know in the field of data science with others so as it becomes a bit easier for them to understand the same concepts

## Future Roadmap:
Blogging schedule
1. Data Science Thought process
2. Random Forests
3. Hadoop setup on VMs
4. Gradient boosting

Other TODOs:
1. Rearrange the resources - move images and data set to individual folders
2. Re-structure blogs and group similar blogs
3. Add a list of common terminology and their definitions
4. Introduce GULP (task manager) to improve workflow
